# Local Symlink Install

Running the unix command `ln` will create a syslink from wherever you clone the repo to your wordpress installation

```

ln -s <path-to-repo> <path-wordpress->/wp-content/plugins/

```

eg:
```
ln -s ~/Desktop/Node/wordpress-plugin-push2talk/push2talk_src/ ~/Desktop/Node/hostgator-v9/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/push2talk
```
